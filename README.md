<h1 align="center">BondoMan Mobile Application</h1>

BondoMan is an application centered around managing transactions efficiently. Users are required to log in initially to access its features, with the endpoint providing a token upon successful login for further access. The app enables users to manipulate transaction data, including addition, modification, and deletion, with minimal input requirements such as transaction title, category (Income, Expense), amount, and location, automatically recording the transaction date and user's location if permitted. Transactions are stored in Room using the Repository Pattern for offline access, displaying them comprehensively with details like transaction category, amount, name, location, and date. Users can add transactions, scan receipts, view transaction summaries via graphs, and export transaction lists to spreadsheets (xlsx or xls) for external viewing. BondoMan also features internet connectivity checks, providing alerts when offline, and incorporates a broadcast receiver in the transaction addition fragment for receiving intents from the "Randomize Transaction" button on the Settings Page.

## üì¢ General Information
Bandung Bondowoso, a project manager tasked with building a thousand temples, faces a daunting challenge. Given a project by Roro, who lacks understanding in project management triangles‚Äîbudget, deadline, and quality‚ÄîBondowoso must complete the monumental task within a single night with limited budget and high-quality expectations. Amidst numerous transactions for purchasing raw materials, precise cost calculations are crucial to align with the initial budget plan, as Roro refuses to pay otherwise. Initially, Bondowoso records all transactions on stone tablets, but with the immense scale of the project, he seeks assistance from the Jin students at the Institute of Jin in their sixth semester to develop a financial management application. He trusts that they possess the intelligence to tackle such a task.

The application built for Bondowoso is tailored to run seamlessly on his Android device, aiding him in managing his finances for the temple construction project. With a focus on tracking transactions, ensuring budget compliance, and facilitating efficient resource allocation, the app is designed to alleviate Bondowoso's burden and streamline the financial aspect of the project. By providing a user-friendly interface for recording transactions, analyzing expenses, and generating reports, the application empowers Bondowoso to make informed financial decisions, ultimately contributing to the smooth progress of the temple construction endeavor.

## üí• Bonus 2 - OWASP Analysis
OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10 is a list of the ten most critical application security risks. Here is our analysis on 3 of them and how we address those security vulnerabilities.

### üîí M8: Security Misconfiguration
Security misconfiguration in mobile apps refers to the improper configuration of security settings, permissions, and controls that can lead to vulnerabilities and unauthorized access. Threat agents who can exploit security misconfigurations are attackers aiming to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform malicious actions. Threat agents can be an attacker with physical access to the device, a malicious app on the device that exploits security misconfiguration to execute unauthorized actions on the target vulnerable application context.

Security misconfigurations in mobile apps can be exploited through various attack vectors, including:
- **Insecure default settings**: Mobile apps often come with default configurations that may have weak security settings or unnecessary permissions enabled, making them vulnerable to attacks.
- **Improper access controls**: Misconfigured access controls can allow unauthorized users to access sensitive data or perform privileged actions.
- **Weak encryption or hashing**: Improperly implemented or weak encryption and hashing algorithms can be exploited to gain access to sensitive information.
- **Lack of secure communication**: Failure to use secure communication protocols, such as SSL/TLS, can expose sensitive data to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Unprotected storage**: Storing sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys, in an insecure manner, such as plain text or weakly encrypted, can lead to unauthorized access.
- **Insecure file permissions**: Storing application files with world-readable and/or world-writable permissions.
- **Misconfigured session management**: Improper session management can result in session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.

Here is how we adress the vulnerabilities.
1. **Debugging Enabled in Manifest**
To prevent exposing sensitive information in debug mode, set `android:debuggable="false"` in the application tag of the AndroidManifest.xml file.
<img src="./assets/owasp/8-1.png"/>

2. **Unprotected Exported Components**
To protect activities from unauthorized access, set `android:exported="false"` for activities that don't need to be accessed by other applications.
<img src="./assets/owasp/8-2.png"/>

3. **Improper Content Provider Permissions**
Limit access to content providers by setting appropriate permissions and ensuring `android:exported="false"` unless necessary for external access.
<img src="./assets/owasp/8-3.png"/>

4. **Improper Content Provider Permissions**
Utilize internal storage or external storage with proper permissions. Before write to user's external download directory, we ask the user permission first. If the user permissions has already been granted then proceed the file saving.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bonus 3 - Accessibility Testing
Accessibility Scanner is a tool developed by Google and used to scan an application's user interface to provide recommendations on how to improve the application's accessibility. Accessibility Scanner enables anyone, not just developers, to quickly and easily identify common accessibility improvements; for example, zooming in on small touch targets, increasing contrast for text and images, and providing content descriptions for unlabeled graphic elements.

The following is what the suggestion page looks like before the application is repaired.
<table style="width:100%; text-align:center;">
    <tr>
        <td width="1%"><img src="./assets/accessibility/initial_by_screen.jpg"/></td>
        <td width="1%"><img src="./assets/accessibility/initial_by_category.jpg"/></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="1%">Result by Page</td>
        <td width="1%">Result by Category</td>
    </tr>
</table>

It was found that there were **171 suggestions** from various different pages. We fulfill all these suggestions based on their categories.
1. **Item Label**
The fix is documented on [this commit](https://gitlab.informatika.org/mikeleo03/if3210-2024-android-ymr/-/commit/ab716260eed6a21d52bdea41ed72232b9dcad370). Here is the updates:
    - For EditTexts or editable TextViews, use an `android:hint` attribute to indicate the purpose of the text field.
    - Use an `android:labelFor` attribute to indicate that a View should act as a content label for another View.
2. **Touch Target**
The fix is documented on [this commit](https://gitlab.informatika.org/mikeleo03/if3210-2024-android-ymr/-/commit/992112745541e4300f45354d0b2469ee691984b9). Here is the updates:
    - Consider making the height of this touch clickable item target 48dp or larger.
    - A parent container may be handling touch events for this item. If selecting the larger container performs the same action as selecting this item, consider defining this item as not clickable. If a different action is performed, consider increasing the size of this item.
3. **Text Contrast**
The fix is documented on [this commit](https://gitlab.informatika.org/mikeleo03/if3210-2024-android-ymr/-/commit/0515b2c1ae5fff32cdbe9fdf353881226ca8859d). Here is the updates:
    - When using `TextView` to display text, use `android:textColor` and `android:background` to define foreground and background colors with a high contrast ratio.
    - The W3C recommends:
        - At least **4.5:1** for small text (below 18 point regular or 14 point bold).
        - At least **3.0:1** for large text (18 point and above regular or 14 point and above bold).
4. **Item Descriptions**
The fix is documented on [this commit](https://gitlab.informatika.org/mikeleo03/if3210-2024-android-ymr/-/commit/a8cf6fd0cdec3c9c0897f072b4be766364aa9887) and [this commit](https://gitlab.informatika.org/mikeleo03/if3210-2024-android-ymr/-/commit/759cbedfbf5614d47dcd2a8e08275a8d13082089). Here is the updates:
    - Each element should have a unique text label that describes its visual meaning, purpose, or associated action.
    - Layouts used as rows within `ListViews` or `RecyclerViews` are often inflated repeatedly. In such a case, the repeated labels should include additional text with more identifying information or context for the description of the item.
5. **Image Contrast**
The fix is documented on [this commit](https://gitlab.informatika.org/mikeleo03/if3210-2024-android-ymr/-/commit/cf9c41c876592a11f7e911cf54f9a64d02cc05be). Here is the updates:
    When using ImageView or Image to render graphical content or iconography, make sure that contrast between foreground and background colors meets or exceeds the recommended ratios.
6. **Unexposed Text**
The fix is documented on [this commit](https://gitlab.informatika.org/mikeleo03/if3210-2024-android-ymr/-/commit/6c04db96aef6fb443e9804021949a6cc3708f669). Here is the updates:
    - Visible text in a user interface component should be available to accessibility services.
    - A ViewGroup that represents a list row is labeled with a contentDescription that customizes the ordering descendant TextViews.
7. **Item Type Label**
The fix is documented on [this commit](https://gitlab.informatika.org/mikeleo03/if3210-2024-android-ymr/-/commit/6c04db96aef6fb443e9804021949a6cc3708f669). Here is the updates:
    - When TalkBack announces a clickable Button element, it appends the word "button" to the text label provided by the developer. If the developer includes "button" in the text label (such as "Save button"), TalkBack might speak the word "button" twice ("Save button button").
    - A well-implemented user interface doesn't add element type or state descriptions to values of `android:contentDescription`, `android:text`, or `android:hint` attributes.

After fulfilling all these quite tiring suggestions, BondoMan finally succeeded in achieving high accessibility with no further recommendations. Here is the final result.
